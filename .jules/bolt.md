## 2025-02-28 - React.memo for recursive list rendering
**Learning:** In React, recursive rendering of lists (like nested comment trees) using inline functions (`renderComment`) causes unnecessary re-renders of the entire tree when state changes (like typing in a form input).
**Action:** Extract recursive render functions into standalone components wrapped in `React.memo`, and ensure props like event handlers are memoized with `useCallback`. This significantly reduces React reconciliation overhead.

## 2025-02-28 - O(N) date parsing optimization for Comment Trees
**Learning:** When constructing recursive nested trees from flat API lists (e.g., comments) and sorting them by date using `Date(string).getTime()`, placing the `new Date()` object instantiation inside the nested `.sort()` function call invokes O(N log N) recursive date parsing operations, which heavily bottlenecks the main thread on platforms that use slower engines for `new Date()`.
**Action:** Pre-compute and map timestamps on the `CommentNode` itself inside an initial, simple O(N) loop before any sorting or recursive mapping occurs, transforming `O(N log N)` date parses into a simple array mutation.
## 2025-04-27 - [Precomputing Timestamps in O(N log N) Sort Operations]
**Learning:** Parsing strings like `Date.getTime()` inside `.sort()` array comparators can cause significant bottlenecks in frequently rendered or large datasets since `.sort()` operations execute the comparator multiple times per item (O(N log N)).
**Action:** Always precompute heavy operations during an initial O(N) map iteration when sorting objects by derived keys, using a Schwartzian transform (map-sort-map).
## 2025-05-01 - Avoid precomputing timestamps unconditionally
**Learning:** Precomputing timestamps for sorting avoids O(N log N) date parsing, but precomputing them unconditionally when the array might be sorted by non-date keys (e.g., alphabetically or by views) introduces unnecessary O(N) date parsing overhead.
**Action:** Only precompute timestamps inside `useMemo` hooks if the selected `sortMode` actually utilizes those timestamps for sorting.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Pre-instantiated Intl.Collator for Sorting
**Learning:** Using `String.prototype.localeCompare` inline inside an `Array.prototype.sort()` comparator instantiates a new `Intl.Collator` object for every single element comparison. This causes significant performance degradation (O(N log N) collator instantiations) on large lists, which is particularly relevant in dashboard settings components mapping large taxonomy datasets.
**Action:** When implementing localized string sorting across the application, always import and use the pre-instantiated collator functions (`comparePtBrVariant` and `compareEnVariant`) exported from `src/lib/search-ranking.ts` to perform O(1) object instantiations instead.
